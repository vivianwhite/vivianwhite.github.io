I am a Computer Science Master's student advised by Dr. Kameron Decker Harris in [WWU's Computational Neuroscience Lab](https://glomerul.us/) graduating in June 2025. I am actively looking for CS PhD programs where I can combine my passion for computational neuroscience and theoretical ML to drive scientific advances in understanding the mathematical principles underlying decision-making in deep networks.
