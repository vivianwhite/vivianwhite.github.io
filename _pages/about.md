I am a Computer Science Master's student advised by Dr. Kameron Decker Harris in [WWU's Computational Neuroscience Lab](https://glomerul.us/) graduating in June 2025. I am actively looking for CS PhD programs for Fall 2025 or Fall 2026 where I can combine my passion for computational neuroscience and machine learning to drive scientific advances in understanding the mathematical principles underlying decision-making in deep networks. I am also seeking data science/ML/research internships for Summer 2025.
