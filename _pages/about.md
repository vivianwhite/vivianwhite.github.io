I am currently a Computer Science Master's student advised by Dr. Kameron Decker Harris in [WWU's Computational Neuroscience Lab](https://glomerul.us/), graduating in June 2025. This summer, I will intern in the AI & Data Analytics division at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory under Henry Kvinge before starting my PhD in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia in Fall 2025, where I will be studying vision and learning advised by Dr. Evan Shelhamer. I am so excited for all that is to come!
